# C# Learning Camp
This repo is an area to document my learning of C#.


## Challenge 1 : Running on Mac

C# is usually used within a Windows environment and while I do have a Windows machine whats the fun in not using my mac and adding extra steps.
First stop to learn how to compile C# documents is old reliable [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/28280082/can-i-program-in-c-sharp-on-a-mac?noredirect=1&lq=1). Visual Studio for Mac will be needed then, I will see if I can run it in VSC because I'm stuborn. 
To download Visual Studio you can download [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio-mac/?sku=communitymac&rel=17). You will need roughly 2-5 GBs of storage depending on what packages you'd liek to install.
